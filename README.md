#Problem definition
The problem that we as a team will be approaching to find a solution involves multiple aspects. Ranging from coming to assistance for people in need of quick jobs for funding themselves, as well as bringing a useful tool to society that will allow citizens to receive help and assign jobs that they need done in exchange for low prices.

#Technologies and tools
The required technology when working with this project include the entity framework: the entity framework can be seen as the main structure of the project as a whole, and holds immense importance for understanding how MPloy will work (further described later in the report under the used architecture section). As for others, the SQL database is used in order to be able to register the students who wish to work as well as the customers who will be paying for their services, into the OES so that both parties are able to smoothly get what they desire which is the vision and purpose of our product. As far as our concern regarding the aspect of the tools that will be used, include Visual Studio as the base IDE, Camunda for BPMN modelling, Palleton for GUI, and most importantly, we are using Google Drive for our report writing, and estimations.

#Methodology
The methodology that we are using for the project is SCRUM. This framework is the best match for small groups (up to 10 persons). Our team consists of 4 members, so the SCRUM is well suited for our group. Also, due to a quite short timespan for our project, SCRUM is coming in handy with its SCRUM events, which let us deliver the product faster and with better quality. SCRUM events are also time-boxed, which helps us to predict and plan our schedule, so we could get the results that we wish for.

#Project planning
To not get lost and to not lose our productivity during the project, we need tools that easies the process of managing the project. During project planning we hold meetings. We do that both physically in school and online, using the Discord app. For planning and assigning the tasks, we are using Trello. Everyone has contributed in every part of the report. It has various templates that let us interact and display our workload visually. With Trello, it is clear what parts are we missing and which ones we need to do or are behind the schedule. If that is the case, we get notifications that alert us to catch up on the work that we are missing. In Appendix A, you can see the screenshot from Trello - plan of the Sprint 0 (as of May 7th). 

#Learning goals

It is always important to analyse the importance of what could be learnt through working with a project, both before and after project completion. In this case, before starting our project, we as a group hoped to better both our skills in writing reports as well as programming a functioning application using the entity framework, razor pages, and databases. What we initially set as our learning goals was to bring our current knowledge regarding the entity framework, razor pages, and databases, further expand those skills and knowledge through working with them, and create a fully functioning application that helps people both find a task in exchange for money, as well as hire others to do a task for them that they needed.
