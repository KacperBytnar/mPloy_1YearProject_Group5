Introduction
Problem definition
The problem that we as a team will be approaching to find a solution involves multiple aspects. Ranging from coming to assistance for people in need of quick jobs for funding themselves, as well as bringing a useful tool to society that will allow citizens to receive help and assign jobs that they need done in exchange for low prices.
Technologies and tools
The required technology when working with this project include the entity framework: the entity framework can be seen as the main structure of the project as a whole, and holds immense importance for understanding how MPloy will work (further described later in the report under the used architecture section). As for others, the SQL database is used in order to be able to register the students who wish to work as well as the customers who will be paying for their services, into the OES so that both parties are able to smoothly get what they desire which is the vision and purpose of our product. As far as our concern regarding the aspect of the tools that will be used, include Visual Studio as the base IDE, Camunda for BPMN modelling, Palleton for GUI, and most importantly, we are using Google Drive for our report writing, and estimations.
Methodology
The methodology that we are using for the project is SCRUM. This framework is the best match for small groups (up to 10 persons). Our team consists of 4 members, so the SCRUM is well suited for our group. Also, due to a quite short timespan for our project, SCRUM is coming in handy with its SCRUM events, which let us deliver the product faster and with better quality. SCRUM events are also time-boxed, which helps us to predict and plan our schedule, so we could get the results that we wish for.
Project planning
To not get lost and to not lose our productivity during the project, we need tools that easies the process of managing the project. During project planning we hold meetings. We do that both physically in school and online, using the Discord app. For planning and assigning the tasks, we are using Trello. Everyone has contributed in every part of the report. It has various templates that let us interact and display our workload visually. With Trello, it is clear what parts are we missing and which ones we need to do or are behind the schedule. If that is the case, we get notifications that alert us to catch up on the work that we are missing. In Appendix A, you can see the screenshot from Trello - plan of the Sprint 0 (as of May 7th). 

Learning goals
It is always important to analyse the importance of what could be learnt through working with a project, both before and after project completion. In this case, before starting our project, we as a group hoped to better both our skills in writing reports as well as programming a functioning application using the entity framework, razor pages, and databases. What we initially set as our learning goals was to bring our current knowledge regarding the entity framework, razor pages, and databases, further expand those skills and knowledge through working with them, and create a fully functioning application that helps people both find a task in exchange for money, as well as hire others to do a task for them that they needed.
Risk analysis
The risk analysis is important at the start of the project to see whether the project is possible to make and create, with the resources that we have. The biggest risks were: lack of experience from the group members and time limitations. In Appendix B there is a full table with all of our risks.
Business analysis
PESTEL analysis
Political
Denmark is a member of the EU and is a member of major economic unions, which makes it easier and possible to expand the business into other countries and regions. Denmark itself encourages innovation and entrepreneurship and has a few funds established for new companies and start-ups such as ''The Danish Growth Fund'' and ''Innovation Fund Denmark''. The World Bank ranked Denmark number 1 in Europe and number 4 in the world in its 2020 Ease of Doing Business Index, ranking 190 nations worldwide. With that being said, Denmark has a great environment for starting a business.
Economical
The Danish economy is recovering fast from the COVID-19 as it caused economic shrinkage, with the growth of GDP by 4.7% in 2021. A gradual reopening from March 2021 enabled an early rebound in household consumption. For example, private spending using credit cards and MobilePay recovered rapidly in 2021. These numbers are showing an increased purchasing power, which will affect our project positively. However, later in 2022 and 2023 the growth should ease and stabilise with a projected growth of GDP in 2023 by 1.7%.
Social
Danish society is egalitarian, which values the principle of equality, meaning that everyone has an equal opportunity and can achieve their individual potential. Because of that, the Danes have a strong sense of community – they trust each other, help each other, and enjoy the company of each other. All things considered, Danes are likely to be positive about the idea of the project. 
Technological
Danish society is considered widely advanced in having high digital literacy. As of 2018, 92% of Danish elder people were using the internet in the period of the last three months, this number was the highest in the EU. Additionally, since our project will be available on the internet, people will have various ways to access it, e.g., the smartphone, PC, etc. That is the best way to approach our potential clients. To substantiate this, in 2019, the number of smartphone users amounted to five million in Denmark and the number is expected to grow continuously. It is a great advantage for our project.
Environmental
Our project involves using only the digital platform, so there is no need of using paper and other physical forms. Because of the great accessibility of our project online, we have decided to not use the advertisement in the physical form, all of our advertisements will take place online or on other platforms that have no negative impact on the environment.
Legal
Our project has to compile data privacy laws, where one of the newest is the EU ePrivacy directive. It regulates the collecting and processing of personal data from visitors in the EU. The taxation in Denmark is also in favour of our project. The corporate tax rate in Denmark as of 2022 is 22%, which places Denmark slightly below the average in Europe (23.97%).
SWOT analysis
Strengths
Giving the citizens the opportunity to earn some extra money.
The person who completed the most tasks during the year at the end is going to receive a bonus.
Ability to work and control when you have free time (more flexibility).
Will be consistently valuable as there is always a demand for jobs

Weaknesses
A lot of preparation is needed applying quality matters standards.
A lot of money is required in order to start the program.
Not enough people or customers will be using the program.
A particular job that is posted by someone may not want to be applied for by others who offer hiring.
It could potentially leave out some people looking for a job as they have no background training in any areas and struggle to do any of the jobs posted.

Opportunities
Expansion of the new technology in different sections.
Has the potential to serve local communities with a useful tool that allows people who are in need of what we offer.
Can increase the working skills of people who are being hired as the more tasks they do, the more experience they will gain.
Has the chance to increase the connections and network of people who are using the app from both sides
Threats
Data security.
Insufficient motivation for people to involve themselves in the program.
Difficult recruiting of the customers.
Lack of trust in the new program because it’s about money.     
Not enough time to have all the desired functionalities in the program.         

TOWS analysis
Threats
In the program that we will create, we assume that all the personal information such as: ( card details, ID, emails, address, phone number etc.) won’t be used in different ways other than the requirements for our system. 

As said before, the people that will have the most completed tasks in the program at the end of the year will have a bonus provided from the company. This will increase the motivation to work as there will be competition between the people looking to be hired.

As long as the program is created for easy tasks such as ( transportation of furniture, cleaning etc.) there is a demand for such a program in the market.

There should be an implementation where the people must pay on the website via online banking when the job is approved and someone has been selected to do it, as well as the people doing the job must not be paid from the company until the job is complete and approved.

When the program is approved and considered functional but at the same time profitable, there is always maintenance for the program as well as time to add more functionalities.


Opportunities
Communities will be able to further advance with technology in their local area as a wide variety of jobs with different skill sets can be posted and will bring more advanced technology to those areas.
Can eventually lead to customers giving feedback on what else they wish our application had which could be useful to them, for when they use our app.
It can be beneficial towards the people who have less work experience than others, in a sense that they could learn new things through working a particular job or find a friend that also is using the app and work the job with them to split the income money and learn skills from them that they did not have before, which they could use to do different jobs than what they have been doing so far.
Can lead to more people using our application, as more people would hear about it. Not only that, but can create more work and hiring opportunities for people who are using our application.
Weaknesses

The program requires a lot of work to be done qualitatively, but at the same time the work that will be done has a lot of potential to meet the standards, especially in lower skilled jobs.
The Start up money that will be needed for the creation of the program could be gained back and in the future through profits of the company.
As long as people are looking for jobs to get money in order to pay rent etc. the program will be useful if they like the vision and idea of our company.
If someone has posted a job that any applicants will not apply for, then the person who has posted the task always has the opportunity to reach out to the company and make a case on their task, if they really need it done, and it may be assessed by the company from there.
In an ideal situation, there will always be more than one job posted. In this scenario, if a job is not suitable for a user looking for a job, then they are able to keep looking through different jobs until they find one that will work.
Strengths

People will always be happy to use the program and spend time in it because of the opportunity to earn extra money.
The person that will show the best results at the end of the year will be awarded with a bonus from the company, which will increase the people's interests in competition.
The application offered by our company gives people the opportunity to be flexible with their work schedule. They will technically be able to be their own employer and give themselves work when they wish to do so. Could also lead to overall popularity for our application
In the society that we currently are living in, there is always a demand for jobs as we run on an economic basis. There are also always people who could use the help from others and are willing to exchange money in return.

Customer Segments
The first and one of the most important blocks that we should consider. Any business needs to identify and know who their customers are so they can meet their interests and needs. Customers can be segmented into different profiles with common customer needs and features. 
In our case customer segmentation could look as follows:
Students – It is known that many students experience financial difficulties, and this service can become an opportunity for them to earn pocket money in exchange for a one-time job.
Elderly people - many older people are faced with the fact that it becomes difficult for them to do certain jobs, whether it's just assembling some furniture, hanging a chandelier or it could be anything they need help with. And the service can provide them with the opportunity to receive this help for a reasonable fee.
People with different levels of income: The opportunity to earn some extra money can be an attractive idea for many people and not only for those with low income. However, the opportunity to earn some pocket money might be more attractive for those with lower income whereas those with average and higher income might be more interested in providing a job they need help with. 
Businesses – We can consider many business types, especially those which provide different services, such as gardening, cleaning, moving services and many others. It could be attractive for them in terms of company promotion and advertising, client base scaling, and as an additional source of income. 

Value Proposition
This block describes the value which company creates for every customer segment by solving their problems and meeting their needs. 
Getting a job done – Service will allow many people to seek help in completing tasks they need help with. 
Extra income – Service will allow many people to earn some extra money for getting a job done. 
Cost reduction – Service will give an opportunity to its customers to find better deals. A person will have to pay much more for the services provided by the company rather than for a person who can do the same job in his spare time. 
Client base scaling – mainly for service companies and entrepreneurs who may seek for additional customers, offer, and advertise their services and get extra income.


Channels
This block describes how every customer segment can be reached by company.
Social media – nowadays social media are one of the best and widely used ways to connect businesses of all sizes with customers, build and promote brands and increase sales. By taking some of the most popular social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, we can reach most of the customer segments.
Website – main place where customers can get all the information about provided services, check guidelines, FAQ, contact with company representatives and sales.
Advertising – includes online and offline advertising. 
Online advertising may include social media marketing, website promotion with search engine optimization, email marketing, social ads, and video marketing with promotional videos on social media platforms. 
Offline advertising may include radio, television, and all types of outdoor advertising, such as billboard ads, flyers, newspaper ads and many more. 

Customer relationships
Customer relationships block describes how the company communicates, keeps, and grows the customer base. 
Social media interactions – constant customer support on social media platforms 
Automated services – is customer support with a reduced human involvement in customer inquiries such as chat bots on a website which can guide people through many popular issues. 
Self-service (Website) – main place where customers can get all the information about provided services, check guidelines, FAQ, contact with company representatives and sales.

Key Activities
This block describes the main activities companies must perform to make business running.
Promotion and advertising of service – one of the main activities for a new online service is to attract as many users as possible and make service recognizable to increase the number of transactions between these users and thereby increase income. 
Service maintenance and development – it is important to keep the service up and running and to allocate time and resources for its improvement. 
Resolution of disputes – If secure payment is used during the occurrence of disputes or claims by one of the parties, the company will need to help to resolve disputes before transferring funds for the completed task. For example, if the work was done badly and the customer refuses to pay the full cost for the service.


Key Resources
This block describes the main resources that the business has. 
Employees – for this type of online service the main resource is its employees who make the service up and running, such as programmers, managers, and customer support workers.

Key Partners
This block describes the main partners playing an important role for the business and its development.
Advertising and marketing agencies – at the beginning of the service development it might be wise to use services of professional advertising agencies, both online and offline, to attract as many users as possible.
Hardware and software providers - equipment, applications, and services necessary for work, such as cloud services, hosting providers, servers, technical support. 

Cost Structure
This block describes the main expenses of the company.
Human resources - the most significant and expensive resource of the service are its employees who help in its development and make it run, such as programmers and customer support workers.
Advertisement and promotion – advertising services can be quite expensive, especially in the beginning of the service development.

Revenue Streams
This block describes the ways a company can generate money from each customer segment.
Commission – is the main source of income of this service as the company is going to charge a small commission for each completed task. 
Task promotion - highlighting and moving the task to the top to draw more attention to the task.
Sell Ad space – selling some free space of the website could be an additional source of income
Secure payment services – retention of money until the task is completed and settlement of disputes for small fee


Conclusion of the business analysis

Overall, we as a team believe that the company creates a value for society in a way that we can help people who are in need for money and looking for quick jobs as they may not have so much time on their hands, due to studies or other reasons as well as people who are also in need of hiring people to do simple tasks for them in exchange for money. Looking back at our business analysis, we can conclude that the outside world model is better than a SWOT analysis since it gives a more accurate representation and estimation of whether the company is to succeed or not and whether it will be an impactful tool that people are able to use. As of the analysis in general, we determined that our business analysis of our project helped us reach a further understanding of what the most impactful areas of our project was, what we needed to implement and code in order to make a fully functioning application that achieves what we set out to do, allow us to better communicate our ideas of what we want to do through things such as models, and receive a better understanding overall for whether our company will be effective or not. When we think about company sustainability, we conclude that our company is sustainable. Reason for this, being that there will always be a demand for jobs, and people in need of others to do jobs for them. As long as we live in today’s society, this consistent requirement will allow our company to always be useful to society and therefore be sustainable.

Sprint 0
Sprint 0 is essential when working with the Agile framework, it helps us to gather all needed information and prepare ourselves for the main sprints. This sprint was supposed to last from April 25th to April 29th, but due to poor time management, we extended it until May 6th, so we could finish properly preparing for our project. During the Sprint Zero, we did the business analysis, which includes: Business Model Canvas, Pestel and SWOT/TOWS analysis, also we brainstormed the Inception deck and GUI design, and created User stories. Additionally, we managed to do the BPMN model for the most important user stories, creating an Entity-Relationship model alongside the database design with normalisation.
Inception deck
WHY:
Why are we here?
To create and design a platform where people can get help doing the household jobs by connecting with the other person who wants to get better at it and get money.

Elevation pitch
For people, who can’t do the household jobs themselves, mPloy is an online community platform that allows users to perform and create tasks for people that are in need of a helping hand. Unlike hiring expensive specialists, our product allows people to save money and to get experience for the people that are doing the job.

Product box
Name of the product: mPloy
Slogan: mPloy - be your own employer
You can find the Product box in Appendix C.

NOT list
We are not implementing a payment system
We are not creating a messaging system
We are not creating a waiting list – the first person who applies, gets the task
We are not creating a ranking system of the users.
We are not creating a final version of the app, just a prototype

What’s Going to give
In this table, we chose 4 different and most important values for our project. Using 0% to 100% scale we lined up these values in priority order, from most important to less important (from 100% to 0%).

What it’s going to take
Time:  One month (from April 25th to May 25th)
Budget: We have no budget, we are working on the project voluntarily. The database will be stored locally, which means that it would not be accessible on the internet, so that leads us to no costs. We are granted free access to Zealand’s work-space zones, which means that we do not have to worry about renting a place.
Team: 4 members, we do not have roles - everyone is contributing to all aspects of our project.
BPMN
The two models are both diagrams for User Story 2 and User Story 5 in a BPMN style, meaning that it can make it easier to see the process of a business plan from the start to the end of a particular session. It is able to achieve this through using several visual notations in order to describe and present the different sorts of actions that need to happen in order for the business process to work. In the model (U.S.2) what is visually presented consists of the process that is done in order to allow the user (in this scenario the person who is trying to apply for a job) to see their own portfolio and use other functionalities of the app. The model does not represent all the different functionalities and show what they do but rather the bigger picture of what the user is able to do and mainly focus on the portfolio. You are able to see the process of what happens when the user requests for the portfolio page: A request to the OES (Open Enterprise Server) for data is sent and is returned. The results are then displayed to the user and further potential actions are then represented, such as logging out. Going into further detail for the other model (U.S.5), as you may see, the model visually represents the process of a user (in this scenario the customer who will be using the application) who wishes to create and post a task that they wish to pay someone to complete for them. The process of the user needing to log in is shown as well as the process from the server’s point of view in what is needed to be done in order to allow the user to get what they desire (creating a task to post on the website that can be done for payment). The model for US2 is in Appendix D and accordingly for US5 in Appendix E.


Domain Model
Domain model represents how the main entities are interacting with each other in mPloy application. These basic objects will be used for core functionality which are: create a user, create a task, apply for a task , approve an applicant and send notifications to users every time an event like a new applicant for your task happens.
User-Task
There are 2 relations between user and task objects (one to zero or many and zero or many to zero or many) because User can be either a Task Creator with the possibility to create multiple tasks or apply for the task as an applicant. On the other hand, a task can have many applicants.
UserBidOnTask is a table that tracks what tasks a user has applied for and which users applied for a particular task.
The Domain Model is in Appendix F.
Class Diagram
The class diagram holds a lot of similarity to the domain model in the sense that it visually demonstrates and represents the attributes, classes, methods, and relationships. The domain model brings a more abstract idea of what is being implemented whereas the class diagram shows a more concrete solution.
There is importance in understanding the class diagram as it is able to give others a better perspective of what is going to be implemented within the application. 
Task object has 3 attributes of Enumeration type: TaskState, TaskCategory and PaymentMethod. Enums help us keep control on what data user inputs in these attributes.
There is a composition relationship between AppUser and UserBidOnTask because Bid couldn’t exist without the User. There is also composition between UserBidOnTask and Task because bid couldn't exist without a task. If the user cancels the task, the bid doesn’t exist anymore.
The Class Diagram is in Appendix G.

Database design and Normalisation
Entity relational diagram

Figure 3 - entity relational diagram

Tables and their relationships shown in the entity relational diagram.

AppUser and Task tables have a one-to-zero-to-many relationship meaning that one user may create many tasks or may not create them at all. And the task could belong only to one user. 
AppUser and UserBidOnTask tables have a zero-to-many relationship same as Task and UserBidOnTask tables. From one side the user may not apply for any tasks, but only create a task, and from the other side zero or many users can apply for a task and one task can have zero or many applicants.
Notification and AppUser tables have one-to-many relationships, meaning that one user can send or receive zero or many notifications while a notification can belong to one user. 




GUI Design
For the design of the graphical interface at the initial stage, we decided to choose soft colours. In the process of selecting colours, we settled on two shades of yellow (235,220,188 and 255,241,197) as a background for the main page and In order to move away from the usual design norms, namely the horizontal divisions of the site, we decided to use a skew element for it. For the task cards, we decided to keep the main body background colour white and make the card footer muted, to add more grey, to make it stand out from the overall page design.
To provide a better user experience our GUI should follow the design heuristics and apply Gestalt laws.

Body layout for all pages rgb(249 246 239):

Main page skew colours:  
Skew1 rgb(235,220,188):




Skew2 rgb( 255 241 197) :


Heuristics
 
Our application should be minimalistic and follow the same standards for every page so that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals, and would not be overwhelmed by information or distracting by unnecessary elements. To make it more user-friendly and readable all text and input fields follow the same design rules, such as rounded corners, dimensions, and fonts. Buttons have the same colours on every page. For the task cards, we decided to keep the main body background colour white and make the card footer muted, to add more grey, to make it stand out from the overall page design. In our opinion, this approach will help the user to easily navigate the site and understand where the important elements of the site are located. The selection of warm colours and rounded corners of the buttons were made so as not to overload the user's eyes with different bright elements and sharp shapes/edges, which will allow him to stay on the site longer and with more comfort and is easier on the eyes and takes less cognitive effort to visually process. We believe that design should speak users' language. It should help to build an experience that feels intuitive, easy to learn, and understand how the interface works.



Main page skew:



Gestalt Law

There are several gestalt principles that are used in our design. Similarity and proximity principles are used in many places, e.g. buttons, shapes, input forms, and colours. For example, we use the same size and colour for most of the main buttons. As for the input fields we use rounded shapes and the same dimensions. The nearness of each input field makes them related to each other and appear as one unit. 
Used architecture


Figure 4 - user architecture

The model that is shown above depicts and represents how the entity framework, that we used within our application, is designed and the way that it works with a database. It is an essential part to our application, since it is truly the backbone of our application as our code is working purely with this framework instead of others such as the ADO.Net framework.The model represents what the entity framework does for us when the code for the application is executed. The specific model that we have presented of our used architecture, shows what happens within the entity framework, in this case, specifically for our project. As you are able to see, we use both User Service(user who is looking for a job) and Task Service(user who is hiring others for a job). The model shows that through configuration and migration, both User Service and the Task Service are able to work with each other and create the connection between both the users who are looking for a job and hiring for a job, within the application itself. They both share common aspects in the sense that they are connected to the same database through AppDBContext as you can see, and makes it possible to create an application around the idea of our company. It is important to understand the model when working with our project, as it is truly the very basis for our code and allows us to bring the idea of our company to life.

Process and implementation
Agile methodology: SCRUM
Scrum is a framework using an agile mindset for developing, delivering and sustaining products in a complex environment. This working method is designed for teams consisting of no more than 10 members. It is considered an adaptive, fast and effective working methodology due to close teamwork and consistent feedback from the team members.

The main objective of Scrum is to satisfy the customer's needs through good communication, collective responsibility and continuous progress.

Below in the picture, you can see the process of SCRUM:

Figure 5 - scrum process

SCRUM team
The Scrum team’s main aim is to create a project. In order to make that an efficient experience team is divided into three different roles:
Project owner;
Scrum master;
Developer team.
The project owner is representing stakeholders and customer voices. The owner of the project also has to deal with the business part (getting financing, etc.) and translate the project vision to the team.
Scrum master is the person who is responsible for guiding the team to comply with the rules of SCRUM methodology, keeping up with the newest methods and providing coaching and other help to the team.
A developer team is a group of professionals who are responsible for meeting the set requirements of every sprint session.

Events in SCRUM
There are five events: 
Sprint; 
Sprint planning; 
Daily Scrum; 
Sprint review; 
Sprint retrospective.

Sprint - a short, time-boxed period (1-4 weeks long, in our case it is 1 week) when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprint is the core of the SCRUM method.
Sprint planning involves defining what is going to be done and how it is going to be done in the Sprint session.
Daily Scrum is a daily brief meeting to evaluate the progress until the end of Sprint and create a work plan for the next 24 hours.
Sprint review is a meeting called at the end of Sprint to examine the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations.
Sprint retrospective is the last meeting of a Sprint to analyse work during the Sprint and implement new ideas to improve the process in the next Sprint session.
With the help of SCRUM, big projects are easier to achieve and manage, and the product usually has a better quality and is more likely to be finished faster due to one of the main SCRUM aspects - consistent feedback and timely prediction.
Product backlog
For the product backlog estimation our team decided to choose a story points approach with relative estimation values. This approach allows us to assess various risks associated with the task, such as lack of experience, task complexity, time constraints and many other similar risks. 
For the scale of our point system, we decided to use the Fibonacci sequence scale in the range of 1 to 21 points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) where 1 point represents the easiest and least important user stories, and 21 points represents the main and most important user stories needed implement for our application to work properly.

Sprint 1
Process
Sprint planning
Our first Sprint started on May 9th and lasted 5 days, making the end of the Sprint on May 13th. We held our first meeting on the first day of the sprint, we discussed the way of implementing features and divided the work where we set up the goals on Trello. Most of the user stories were finished in Sprint Zero, and the other user stories (US16 and US15) came along the way.

Figure 6 - burndown chart sprint 1 

The goal of the sprint
For Sprint 1 we decided to implement 8 user stories (US1, US2, US5, US4, US16, US3, US15 and US8) - the core of our program. The main functionalities for this Sprint were creating a log-in and register functions, creating and assigning the user to the tasks, and displaying all the users on a waiting list for a specific task. 
Implementation
During sprint 1 our team did not manage to implement all the user stories as some of the tasks required more time and experience than we thought during the planning. So we had to finish some tasks during the second sprint and devote more time on our time management.

Design Sequence Diagrams
US 5:
To be able to create a task the user must be logged in, after the login the user is redirected to the main page, where he can find the “Create Task '' button, after clicking on this button the task creation form will appear. After filling all the “required” fields and clicking the “create” button, the task is created in the database, and the user is redirected to the pool where all tasks are displayed. The Design Sequence Diagram is available in Appendix H.
US 2: 	
In order to login, the user has to press the “LogIn” button located on layout. Click on the button redirects the user to the Login Page where the user is requested to enter his username and password.
When a user submits the form his username and password is passed to Login Page Model through Data Binding where a method PasswordSignInAsync(username, password) provided by SignInManager from Identity User is called. This method checks whether there is any user with a matching username and password in the database. If the check succeeds then the result variable is assigned as true, user gets properly logged in and user gets redirected to Home Page and name is displayed on the layout.
In case the method returns false, an error message is displayed on the Login Page and the user is asked to enter username and password again. The Design Sequence Diagram is available in Appendix I.
Design Class Diagram

This design class diagram represents the design necessary for implementation of the first 5 user stories during the first sprint. It shows behaviour between basic class models, page models, interfaces and services.
CreateUserModel and LoginModel don’t use AppUser class because they have their own models that store necessary data for registration and login. They also don’t need to use EFUserServices because registration and login are implemented using SignInManager and UserManager services which are part of Identity User
Pages responsible for applying for tasks, task creation and displaying all tasks use Task and UserBidOnTask classes as blueprint and Entity Framework services which communicate with databases through DBContext and implement methods from their interfaces. The Design Class Diagram is available in Appendix J.
Reflection of Sprint 1
At the end of the Sprint, we could see that our goals were not fully finished due to our low velocity. The other important reason for not finishing all our goals was the lack of daily scrums, sprint review and sprint retrospective events in the team. Because of the lack of Sprint review and Sprint retrospective events, we did not include the unfinished user stories in the second Sprint. What we learned is that tools like Trello, make it clear who, when and what are the things that should be implemented. So we continued using Trello in the second Sprint.
Sprint 2
Process
Sprint planning
Our second Sprint started on May 16th and finished on May 20th, making it five days. As in the first Sprint, we held our meeting on the first day of the second sprint, we discussed the way of implementing features and divided the work where we set up the goals on Trello. During the first meeting, we created some of the new user stories, the other user stories were born in the Sprint 2 process.

Figure 7 - Burndown chart sprint 2

Goal of the sprint
For the second Sprint, we decided to implement 9 user stories (US9, US14, US6, US10, US17, US7, US12, US13 and US11) - the additional features of our program. The main functionalities for this Sprint were the sorting, deletion of the tasks, displaying only the user’s tasks, making log-out and creating profile edit functionalities. These user stories were intended for better app performance and the details that make the app look more appealing.
Implementation
For the second sprint, we estimated that we could devote around 120 hours to finish it. Due to some tasks not finished during the first sprint our team had to be focused more on the most important user stories so the overall application performance could meet our main goals. During sprint 2, we managed to implement more user stories than in sprint 1, however we underestimated the complexity of some tasks and  due to lack of experience some of the tasks were not finished.

Design Class Diagram
This design class diagram represents design necessary for implementation of user stories included in the second sprint backlog. It shows behaviour between basic class models, page models, interfaces and services. 
It is updated with all the methods we have created during the 2nd sprint for implementation of functionalities. It doesn’t show registration and login process but it’s extended with Display User Model and AppUser interfaces and services including methods responsible for displaying and editing user profiles.
GetAllTasks and Application Models are dependent on 2 interfaces because they use methods defined in both services. The Design Class Diagram is in Appendix K.
Reflection of Sprint 2
Because of the lack of the SCRUM events such as Daily Scrums, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective. We continued making the same mistakes and not achieving the goals that were set at the beginning of the project, this experience showed us the importance of ALL Scrum events and why they all needed to be included.
Reflection
As a reflection, some significant points of learning that we experienced during the process of working on the project that must be taken into consideration include: better documentation in the process of working is essential, not only does it allow you to get the most accurate results of what you did when it comes to the final report, but also makes it easier for you to write the report as a whole. Another learning point was that we learnt how to handle databases using the entity framework. Why this is so significant sort of explains itself, as it helped a lot with implementing the other tasks and made it almost fall into place. It also holds significance in the sense that if we were to work with the entity framework again in the future including databases, it could be the solution to fixing multiple potential bugs and problems that we could face. Finally, we understood how different pages can communicate with each other and pass data through URLs. Although it might not have been our initial goal to learn the complication of this idea, it came to us naturally as we further had to write code with razor pages. At first we understood this idea, but it was still abstract. As we started to practically work with it, it gradually came to us and eventually allowed us to get the bigger picture of Razor Pages and how they communicate with each other. As for the reflection of the product overall, we came to the conclusion that we were not able to accomplish what we initially set out to do. Meaning in a more practical way, we came up with one sprint too short. We believe that the reason behind this includes both a mixture of poor time management and an unrealistic goal. We could have done better by doing more consistent work on a daily basis rather than doing a heavy load of work over a few days every week. As for the reasoning regarding an initial unrealistic goal, we were not able to fully implement all the functionalities that we wished the application would have in the end result, as some of the functionalities that we wished to implement were just above our skill cap as a team. We also believe as a team that due to this reason of some functionalities being out of our skill range, it could have also affected our motivation by decreasing it gradually over time which eventually ended with not going the further steps to teach ourselves the skills that we needed to implement the more complicated functionalities into our final application.
Conclusion
As for the conclusion, we were able to overall decide that we were able to implement the core of what we initially desired regarding the functions of our application. Although we were able to implement the base of what we wanted and additional features, there is always room for improvement. Something in particular that we were not able to design and get fully working was the idea of approving a task for the users that send an application for a posted task. Although the program will not crash on the client side, we were not able to get it to work in the way that we wanted, since after the application is sent from the user, we were not able to implement any way to approve their application. The reasons for why we failed at the task of being able to implement this, in our opinion as a team, was due to both the mixture of more requirements than our skill level and a lack of time. We could have improved our overall process for the project by making better time management which would lead to more motivation to push ourselves for further learning in different areas, potentially allowing us to implement more functionalities that require more skill. As for what we did well in the process, we believe that we were able to manage our teamwork quite well by planning everything out in multiple boards within trello, keeping communications with each other, and assigning small segments of work rather than larger ones allow us to give each other time to check the work that we have done. We believe that this led to a more unified piece of work overall between us.   Nonetheless, from a long-term perspective of what we were capable of achieving by the end of this assignment: a functioning app for our company idea, expanding our knowledge in the software development (databases, entity framework, and razor pages), being able to work better as a team, and writing a report on what was done and how it was done, We believe that we were able to reach goals that we set to do as a team, both for our company idea (problem definition) and further learning of software development and understanding business for ourselves.
